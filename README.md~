# A Fully Convolutional Neural Network for Speech Enhancement

Tensorflow 2.0 implementation of the paper [A Fully Convolutional Neural Network for Speech Enhancement](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9ed8/e2f6c338f4e0d1ab0d8e6ab8b836ea66ae95.pdf)

This code is a standalone extension of [this code] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daitan-innovation/cnn-audio-denoiser/)
Which in turn is based on this blog post: [Practical Deep Learning Audio Denoising](https://medium.com/better-programming/practical-deep-learning-audio-denoising-79c1c1aea299)

## Dataset

Although a partial part of the dataset is said to be available on the above
github repo, it isn't there.  Therefore you need to download the two datasets
below. 

- [Mozilla Common Voice](https://voice.mozilla.org/)
- [UrbanSound8K](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html)

You can then use ```create_dataset.py``` script to create the TFRecord files. 

You will then need to update the paths of these datasets in default_config.py.

## Training

Use train.py to train an audio denoiser

## Requirements

You need to install tensorflow and keras and some other bits and pieces.  It
would be best to follow the guidance on installing TF on it's website.
